## I. Business Organization and Relationships
### Business Organizations: The Role of Cybersecurity in an Organization
Up until the last fifteen years, starting an organization did not entail cybersecurity. It is now a key success factor for business. Sherwood et al., suggested cybersecurity be viewed as the “enabler” by which the organization grows and prospers.

#### Challenges of Business Relationships
Understanding the risk from both a business and technical perspective while navigating both worlds with equal agility is critica.

Here are some ways a strong security system leads to growth and success:
1. A robust security system will enable an organization to win customers and retain customer loyalty.
2. A strong security system will give an organization confidence when seeking to expand into new areas or markets.
3. A well-rounded security system can result in boosting brand equity.

## II. Risk Assessment Template
### Why is cybersecurity a risk assessment?
A cybersecurity risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risk. It helps to ensure that the cybersecurity controls you choose are appropriate to the risks your organization faces.

#### The aim of the risk assessment process is to evaluate hazards:
1. Map Your Assets.
2. Identify Security Threats & Vulnerabilities.
3. Determine & Prioritize Risks.
4. Analyze & Develop Security Controls.
5. Document Results From Risk Assessment Report.
6. Create A Remediation Plan To Reduce Risks.
7. Implement Recommendations.
8. Evaluate Effectiveness & Repeat.

#### What are risk assessment tools?
One class of algorithmic tools, called risk assessment instruments (RAIs), are designed to predict a defendant's future risk for misconduct.

#### What are the main three steps in risk assessment?
Risk assessment is the name for the three-part process that includes:
- Risk identification.
- Risk analysis.
- Risk evaluation.
